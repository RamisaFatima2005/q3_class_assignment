**Overview**

This project is a Typing Speed Tracker app built using Streamlit and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The app lets users test their typing speed and accuracy by typing a random sentence. The core functionality is encapsulated in the TypingSpeedTracker class, which handles the logic for sentence generation, accuracy calculation, and words per minute (WPM) calculation.

The app provides feedback based on accuracy and speed, encouraging users to practice more.
