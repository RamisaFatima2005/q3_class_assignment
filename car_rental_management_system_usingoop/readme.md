Overview
This Python-based Car Rental Management System uses Streamlit to manage car rentals. The program allows users to:

View Available Cars: Displays cars that are available for rent.

Rent a Car: Select a car, enter the rental days, and calculate the total rent.

Add a New Car: Admins can add new cars to the fleet by providing car details.

It tracks car availability and calculates rental charges based on the number of rental days. The system uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to manage car data and rental operations.
